# Caching rules

It uses [cache-control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) headers to know if the cache is outdated (max-age and eTag).
If it is outdated the cached version is shown directly and the server is requested for an update. If the server sends a new image it updates the image directly.
